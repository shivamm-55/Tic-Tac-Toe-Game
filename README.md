# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python.

**Description**
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns to mark their symbol (either 'X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The player who successfully places three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all cells are filled, and no player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

**Features**
Player vs Player: Two human players can play against each other on the same machine.
Player vs AI: Play against an intelligent AI that makes strategic moves.
